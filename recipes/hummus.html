    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This <strong>hummus</strong> is a quick version of the classic recipe and can prepared in as little as five minutes. In my house this is a staple, and I have a glass dish of it in my fridge all the time. Hummus is versatile and can be served with fresh vegetables as a dip or as garnish with a main course. This particular hummus is oil free, vegan and gluten free</p>
